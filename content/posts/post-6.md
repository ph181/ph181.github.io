In the classroom, simulations can be used, for example, to make unclear content in electrical engineering and electronics can be made more accessible to learners through simulations. Additional motivation is provided the integration of such a simulation in a serious game. The motivating effect of of serious games is assumed to be in the flower life. The experience of flow should not only motivation, the experience of flow should also have an influence on the learning effectiveness of serious games and increase the learners' expectation of self-efficacy. In order to investigate these relationships empirically to be able to investigate these relationships empirically, a serious game was developed on the content of electricity theory. The following article presents the game Lights Out and the associated research project.
