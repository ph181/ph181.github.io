A year ago i stood on a wakeboard for the first time, in the middle of august i used my vacation to really get started with my first own board.
This season I've already been riding more often than last year in total, but my progress is limited.

So far I've managed the frontside 180 and switch FS 180. The next step is to do the backside 180 on the water surface and in combination with an ollie.

In the meantime, the handover is also working ;)
However, the trick still doesn't work on the kicker.
